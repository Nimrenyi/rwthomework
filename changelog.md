### 0.0.3.0

- fix exercise_number generation for files without numerical ending

#### Moodle

- make progress bar only print on download and add new line after finished
- create insight directory if doesn't exist
- fixed bug: now you can determine which rulesets should be used
- fixed bug: visible assignments that deny access caused moodle (the subpackage, not the server LOL) to stop
- renamed name-path-string to location because in rulesets it is called location
- token file doesn't need to have file extension .txt anymore.
- Moodle differentiates between submissions and teamsubmissions. This caused issues with the origin rule. Fixed.
